Lesson 2 using node.js
That first line was written using the fs.writeFile native node module
That module was executed via index.js, using "node index.js" from the command line while making sure we were in this dir
now we read back this entire file to the console by adding some fs.readFile native node module
more details about all native node modules in the node documentation https://nodejs.org/docs/latest-v22.x/api/index.html
