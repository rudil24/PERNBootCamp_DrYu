# Boss Level Challenge 2: Simon Game

## *Udemy \- Dr. Angela Yu \- WebDev Bootcamp*

# Project Description

* Using what you've learned in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and jQuery, build a web app version of the 80's Simon game (sound/color memory sequencing challenge.)

# Deliverable(s)

* Working game delivered to a project space on GitHub  
* [Code flow diagram](Simon_Game_flow_rudil24.pdf)

# Procedure

1. Got the project files with the sounds assets pre-styled button assets

2. Linked up my JavaScript (blank) game.js and jQuery 3.7 links via index.html \<script\> links just above \</body\> 

3. Played the example and drew out how that flow would translate through my logic and assets (see code flow diagram deliverable, above)

4. I tried to code the obvious functions first (random number/color generator,) but ended up having to see where some of the repetition needed to be in code before i pulled those into functions (user pattern and master pattern had a lot of similar setup/play sound stuff going on.)

5. After a few debug issues in F12 Chrome Dev Tools i got the code working and then worked on some of the visual responsiveness since i mostly use half a laptop screen to access these exercises (other half reserved for note taking ðŸ˜€.

# Reflection

* i'm more of a written outline than flowchart guy, but drawing this one really did help me think through game flow vs setup / initialize / re-initialize steps  
* i've got to continue to progress in console debugging, throwing small snippets into the chrome dev console and getting those airtight. the challenges will only get harder and i got stuck a few times with bugs that i just couldn't isolate very well b/c of my inexperience with the chrome dev console.  
* i didn't like the game's responsiveness on smaller screens, so i quickly threw in some grid and flex, but it really still looks hacky to me (i wanted it to always keep the 2x2 button shape/positioning and shrink/grow where needed. I need almost daily challenges in that area, and come back and polish this one before i put it in my portfolio.

# Reference Material

* If you're unfamiliar with how the Simon game works, feel free to first [head over to the London App Brewery's Example of the game](https://londonappbrewery.github.io/Simon-Game/) and play with it before starting the challenge.
