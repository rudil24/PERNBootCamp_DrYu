 <h1>Rudi's Favorite Movies</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time. </h2>
<hr />
<h3>There Will Be Blood</h3>
<p>DDL at his very best, and a master class in human behavior</p>
<h3>Godfather I and Godfather II</h3>
<p>Can't really separate these (i love the chronologocical remix) so they go in together.</p>
<h3>Shawshank Redemption</h3>
<p>Stephen King is my favorite writer, but the screenplay treatment and acting in this one will live forever.</p>
