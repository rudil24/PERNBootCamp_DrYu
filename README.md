# PERN Boot Camp Exercises - Rudi Lewis
This repo holds my work as a student in the Udemy course [The Complete Full-Stack Web Development Bootcamp](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-web-development-bootcamp) by Dr. Angela Yu
This repo is intended to do two things:
* show my evolving skills in full stack programming
* allow a full immersion into version control: git in combo with vscode and github to enable push/pull/fork code from my various PCs and laptops to the github repo

The course and my learning concentrates on JavaScript implementations in the PERN stack, namely:
P = PostGres aka PostGreSQL -- relational database management system
E = express.js --  back end web application framework for building RESTful APIs with Node.js
R = React.js --  front-end JavaScript library that aims for more seamless front ends via component-based user interfaces
N = node.js -- the JavaScript runtime environment

And of course HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and jQuery are building blocks covered in the early part of the course & exercises.
