# PERN Boot Camp Exercises - Rudi Lewis
This repo holds my work as a student in the Udemy course [The Complete Full-Stack Web Development Bootcamp](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-web-development-bootcamp) by Dr. Angela Yu
This repo is intended to do three things:
<br>
1. show my evolving skills in full stack programming
1. help me immerse into version control: git in combo with vscode and github, so i can add/commit/push/clone/branch/fork code from my various PCs and laptops to the github repo
1. become a repository of code snippets that can quickly remind me of problems and how to solve them in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and more


The course and my learning concentrates on JavaScript implementations in the PERN stack, namely:   
| Letter | Stands For | Role |
| :---: | :--- | :--- |
| **P** | PostGres    | aka PostGreSQL -- relational database management system with good marks in security, flexibility, and scalability for structured data|
| **E** | Express.js | back-end Node.js web application framework that simplifies server-side development tasks like routing, middleware management, and request/response handling |
| **R** | React.js | front-end JavaScript library that aims for more seamless front ends via component-based user interfaces |
| **N** | Node.js | THE JavaScript runtime environment |
   
Naturally the course also covers the foundational building blocks of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and jQuery.
