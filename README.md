# PERN Boot Camp Exercises - Rudi Lewis
This repo holds my work as a student in the Udemy course [The Complete Full-Stack Web Development Bootcamp](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-web-development-bootcamp) by Dr. Angela Yu
This repo is intended to do three things:
<br>
1. show my evolving skills in full stack programming
1. immerse me in version control (git in combo with vscode and github) so i get comfortable with checking in and checking out code from various devices and operating systems to/from this github repo
1. become a resource of focused code snippets I can refer back to for specific programming tasks and how I solved them
   
The course and my learning concentrates on JavaScript implementations in the PERN stack, namely:   
| Letter | Represents | Role |
| :---: | :--- | :--- |
| **P** | PostGres    | aka PostGreSQL -- relational database management system with good marks in security, flexibility, and scalability for structured data|
| **E** | Express.js | back-end Node.js web application framework that simplifies server-side development tasks such as routing, middleware management, and request/response handling |
| **R** | React.js | front-end JavaScript library that aims for more seamless front ends via component-based user interfaces |
| **N** | Node.js | the most widely used JavaScript runtime environment, enabling server-side execution of JavaScript for scalable web-based applications |
   
Naturally the course also solidifies my learning in the fundamental building blocks of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and jQuery.
